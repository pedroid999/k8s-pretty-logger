Create an application with python and vue to achieve this prompt: 

I need to develop an MVP to visualize Kubernetes pod logs (specifically GKE) using python with jinja2 template engine and vue for frontend. 
The application should be simple but functional, allowing users to connect to a GKE cluster, list available pods, and view their logs in real-time.

Please help me with:

1. The Python + vue project structure. Scaffolding must be with uv and a pyproject.toml for dependencies and a venv like is explained on context doc.
2. github repository is https://github.com/pedroid999/k8s-pretty-logger
2. User interface code including:
   - Kubernetes context selector
   - Namespace and pod list
   - Log viewer with basic filtering options
   - Auto-scroll and ability to pause updates
3. Logic for:
   - GKE authentication using local credentials
   - Communication with Kubernetes API to list pods
   - Real-time log streaming
4. Error handling and loading states
5. A detailed README.md that includes:
   - Prerequisites (dependencies, tools) for Mac, Windows, and Linux
   - Step-by-step instructions for setting up the development environment
   - Commands to start the application in development mode for each operating system
   - Troubleshooting common installation issues
   - Project file structure to help new developers navigate
   - How to configure GKE connection
   - **Quick Start section with single commands for users who just want to run the application immediately**


The README.md should be especially detailed and friendly, with the goal that any developer can start the application in a few minutes, regardless of their operating system. 
Include options for quick starts (all-in-one commands) and more detailed explanations for those who need to understand each step. For end users who just want to use the application, 
there should be a prominent section at the top of the README with the quickest way to download and run the compiled application.
